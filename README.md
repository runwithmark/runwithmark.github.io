# Run With Mark

## Will you run 1 mile every day?

Mark Zuckerberg committed to running 365 miles in 2016.

Accept his challenge and track your progress on http://runwithmark.github.io.

## History

I started running with the goal of averaging 1 mile per day, but soon realized how hard it was to monitor my progress. Is today day 34 or 35? And how many miles do I need to run next Sunday to stay on pace?

I track my runs with Runkeeper, but I also track other activities there -- even with just 10 runs this year, it was getting hard to go back in history, find them and sum up the total miles run.

So I created a simple dashboard to pull my data directly from Runkeeper and display two easy numbers: day and miles run. My friends liked the idea, so we started polishing the design, adding a chart of the progress... and more to come.

Hope this will help with your running too!
